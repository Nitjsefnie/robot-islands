// §9.3 Robotics — building construction time mechanic. Pure logic, no DOM.
//
// Every placed building has a `constructionRemainingMs` counter. While > 0
// the building is "under construction": it does NOT produce, does NOT
// contribute to power balance, and does NOT accrue maintenance operating
// time. The counter decrements each `advanceIsland` segment by dt and the
// building flips to operational the moment it reaches 0.
//
// Robotics sub-path's `constructionTimeMul` divides the base time at the
// moment of placement (NOT continuously) so a Robotics purchase mid-build
// does not retroactively speed up the in-progress building — it speeds up
// the NEXT placement.
