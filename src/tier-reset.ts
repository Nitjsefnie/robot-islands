// Per-island Tier Reset per SPEC §9.7. Pure logic — no PixiJS, no DOM.
//
// A player can pay a placeholder T2-T3 component cost to revert a Tier-3+
// island to Tier 1, primarily to undo a §9.4 Specialization Passive
// declaration or a poorly-chosen §9.3 sub-path commitment. Tier breakpoint
// state reverts to T1; T2+ buildings remain placed but the runtime tier
// gate in `computeRates` zeroes their effective rate until the island
// re-climbs into the relevant tier band.
//
// Preserved by reset:
//   - All placed buildings (operatingMs / maintainedAt timestamps intact).
//   - Terrain, tile types (these live on IslandSpec, not IslandState — out
//     of reach of this function by construction).
//   - Modifiers (also IslandSpec).
//   - Local inventory (minus the cost deducted at execution time) and
//     storage caps (derived from the preserved buildings via aggregate).
//   - `funnelPending` (§10) — spec is silent; preserving matches the
//     "full stockpile preserved" spirit of §9.7's "local inventory".
//   - `aiCoreCrafted` / `ascendantCoreCrafted` — these are "once-ever-crafted"
//     historical flags. Spec says "tier breakpoint state reverts to T1",
//     which we read as the level/tier band only; the historical AI-core
//     and Ascendant-core flags are NOT tier breakpoints.
//
// Cleared by reset:
//   - `level → 1`, `xp → 0`.
//   - Spent skill points refunded as `unspentSkillPoints`, then
//     `unlockedNodes` and `subPathProgress` cleared.
//   - `specializationRole` and `declaredAt` cleared (back to undeclared
//     Generalist).
//
// 24-real-time-hour cooldown between resets on the same island
// (placeholder per §9.7).
//
// Merged islands (§3.6) operate as a single identity per spec — that
// integration is deferred until §3.6 ships and is not handled here.
