// §4.4 / §4.5 buff-adjacency resolution.
//
// SPEC §4.4: "Adjacency is computed using 4-neighbors. For a multi-tile
// building, the adjacent set is the union of tiles bordering any cell of the
// footprint, minus the footprint itself."
//
// SPEC §4.5 (buff form): "building gains a multiplier per matching neighbor,
// capped at N. Format: `+X% statKey per adjacent matchType, max N matches`."
//
// `computeBuffStack` returns the multiplicative buff multiplier to apply to
// a building's recipe rate. It walks the focal building's 4-neighbor border,
// collects the set of distinct neighbor building ids that touch the border,
// and for each AdjacencyBuff entry on the focal building's def counts the
// number of neighbors satisfying the entry's `matchKind` predicate (capped
// at `maxMatches`). Multiple entries compose multiplicatively; within a
// single entry, N matches contribute additively as `1 + N × percentPerMatch/100`.
//
// Pure module — no PixiJS, no DOM. The 4-neighbor footprint walk mirrors
// `heat.ts`'s pattern (footprintKeySet → borderTiles); we keep the helpers
// local rather than exporting them from heat.ts so the two resolvers can
// evolve independently. Both compute the same set per §4.4.
//
// Both buff adjacency (`computeBuffStack`) and gating adjacency (`checkGates`)
// are implemented in this module per SPEC §4.5.
