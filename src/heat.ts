// Heat-source adjacency resolution per SPEC §5.2.
//
// Heat is NOT a grid. It is an N:1 adjacency relationship between heat-consuming
// buildings (Blast Furnace, Pyroforge, Electric Arc Furnace, Coke Oven) and
// heat-source buildings (Coal Furnace, Geothermal Vent, Plasma Heater, Fusion
// Core). A single source serves any number of adjacent consumers; the source's
// fuel consumption (if any) multiplies by the count of consumers it serves.
//
// Algorithm (§5.2):
//
//   For each consumer in lex-sorted-id order:
//     - Compute the consumer's 4-neighbor border tiles (exclude self-footprint).
//     - Find all source buildings whose footprint overlaps any border tile.
//     - Priority:
//         a) If any FREE source (Geothermal/Plasma/Fusion) is adjacent →
//            hasHeat=true, no fuel cost increment.
//         b) Else if any COAL source is adjacent → hasHeat=true; assign to the
//            lowest-id coal source; increment its served count.
//         c) Else → hasHeat=false. Consumer cannot operate this tick.
//
// Pure module — no PixiJS, no DOM. Imports `footprintTiles` from shape-mask.ts
// and BUILDING_DEFS from building-defs.ts.
//
// Catalog asymmetry note: this resolver reads `requiresHeat` / `heatSource`
// from the canonical `BUILDING_DEFS` table, NOT from the per-call `defs`
// catalog override threaded through `computeRates`/`RatesContext`. That's
// intentional — heat-source / heat-consumer status is treated as a static
// catalog fact (intrinsic to a defId), unlike `power` which test fixtures
// commonly override to isolate non-power code paths. If a future test needs
// to disable heat for a def, it should mutate the catalog imports directly,
// or strip `requiresHeat` from the def via the same `{ requiresHeat: _, ...rest }`
// idiom the economy tests use for `power`.
