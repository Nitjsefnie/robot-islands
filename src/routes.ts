// Inter-island routes: pure logic for cargo transit + funneling credit
// accumulation (SPEC §2.4 / §10 / §15.4).
//
// No PixiJS, no DOM. The renderer (`routes-ui.ts`) reads this module's state
// and draws; the main ticker calls `tickRoutes` once per frame to deliver
// arrivals and dispatch the next batch.
//
// Scope notes:
//   - All route tiers (T1 cargo, T2 drone cargo, T3 airship, T4 mass driver,
//     T4 teleporter, T5 spacetime anchor) share this `Route` shape and have
//     per-tier capacity and transit-time constants wired.
//   - Weather modulation of capacity and in-flight loss implemented per §2.6.
//   - Multi-route contention on the same source resource is implemented per
//     §15.4 (proportional distribution by capacity).
//   - Tier-gating on route-class placement runs through `buildingUnlocked` at
//     validate-placement time like every other tiered building.
