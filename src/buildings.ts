// Per-instance building placement + rendering.
//
// `PlacedBuilding` is the per-instance runtime: a unique id, the BuildingDefId
// pointer into the static catalog (`building-defs.ts`), and tile coordinates.
// Static per-kind data — footprint, fill, stroke, recipe binding, power —
// lives on `BuildingDef`; rendering looks it up via `BUILDING_DEFS[b.defId]`.
//
// The split lands per SPEC §15.1: many instances share one def, the def
// table drives the Building Catalog UI, and the placement runtime stays
// minimal. Rotation lives here too — wired into the type as
// `rotation: 0|1|2|3` but unused for step 9 (placement is deferred to
// step 2.5, so every demo instance ships rotation: 0).

 *   - DESAT_AMOUNT: 0.30 pulls 30% toward grayscale. Keeps each building
 *     identifiable by hue but stops the workshop's saturated orange / dock's
 *     candy-blue from screaming.
 *   - SHADOW_*: 2px down-right offset, dark fill at 0.4 alpha. Sells the
 *     "raised plate" feel without a real lighting pass.
 *   - BEVEL_*: 1px inner-top highlight + 1px inner-bottom shadow give a
 *     subtle stamped-metal look. Alphas tuned to read at zoom 1.0 without
 *     swamping the glyph.
 *   - GLYPH_SCALE: glyph height = TILE_PX × footprint-min × this. 0.5 lands
 *     ~24px on a 2×2 building and ~48px on a 4×4 — readable at default zoom.
 *   - GLYPH_LIGHTEN: 70% blend toward white. Glyph reads as light-on-dark on
 *     every fill, including the cyan / pink / pale-mint pastels in the T5
 *     band. (Bitwise tricks vary wildly across fills; a fixed blend is

 * axis. The inset leaves a thin gap so the underlying terrain colour is

 * destroys the Container via `destroy({ children: true })`, which cascades
