// Building placement — pure tile math + validation + state mutation.
//
// SPEC §4 in summary:
//   §4.1 footprint shapes — buildings cover one or more tiles. Step 2.5
//        simplifies to rectangular footprints (BuildingDef.width × .height);
//        custom L-tromino / tetromino shapes per §4.1 are DEFERRED (no current
//        def uses them). The footprint mask is implicit `[(0,0)..(w-1,h-1)]`.
//   §4.2 rotation — 4-way (0/90/180/270 CW). For a rectangle this just swaps
//        width/height on rotation 1/3 (no-op on 0/2). The transform here is
//        written to also work when a non-rectangular shape mask lands later.
//   §4.3 placement rules — every footprint tile must be inscribed in the
//        island ellipse (§3.4), no tile may overlap any existing footprint,
//        and the def must be tier-unlocked (§9.2 / §13.1).
//   §4.4 adjacency — metadata only; effect computation DEFERRED (no consumer
//        wired yet — Step 11 added the heat-source flag plumbing but the
//        per-frame buff computation is still a future step).
//
// Other deferrals documented at the call sites:
//   - Terrain-tile requirements per §4.3 (Mine "should" need ore vein, Logger
//     a tree tile, etc.) — DEFERRED. No current BuildingDef carries a
//     `requiredTile` field; step 2.5 accepts any in-island tile.
//   - Adjacency effects (§4.5) — DEFERRED.
//   - Placement-time material cost — DEFERRED. Placement is free in step 2.5;
//     real costs land in step 14 alongside the cost-curve work.
//   - Demolition — DEFERRED. Placed buildings cannot be removed in step 2.5.
//
// No PixiJS, no DOM, no IslandState construction-time helpers — this module
// is pure: takes a spec + state + def id + anchor + rotation, returns a
// validation verdict, optionally appends a new PlacedBuilding.

 * All tile coordinates a rectangular footprint of nominal `width × height`

 *
 * Convention: rotation pivots around the anchor and stays anchored at the
 * top-left of the AXIS-ALIGNED bounding box that wraps the rotated shape.
 * For a w×h rectangle the bounding box is (w × h) on rotations 0/2 and
 * (h × w) on rotations 1/3. The set of tiles a 2×3 rectangle covers under
 * rotation 1 is therefore a 3×2 axis-aligned block at the same anchor —
 * just with the original "width axis" now running vertically. This matches
 * the §4.2 spec where rotation does not move the placement origin, only
 * reshapes the footprint extent.
 *
 * Implementation: enumerate the original footprint mask (implicit
 * [0..w-1] × [0..h-1] for step 2.5), rotate each (dx, dy) into the bounding
 * box coordinate system, emit (anchor + rotated). The math is general
 * enough that swapping to an explicit shape mask (when L-trominoes land)
 * only requires changing the enumeration source.
