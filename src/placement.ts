// Building placement — pure tile math + validation + state mutation.
//
// SPEC §4 in summary:
//   §4.1 footprint shapes — buildings cover one or more tiles. Step 2.5
//        simplifies to rectangular footprints (BuildingDef.width × .height);
//        custom L-tromino / tetromino shapes per §4.1 are DEFERRED (no current
//        def uses them). The footprint mask is implicit `[(0,0)..(w-1,h-1)]`.
//   §4.2 rotation — 4-way (0/90/180/270 CW). For a rectangle this just swaps
//        width/height on rotation 1/3 (no-op on 0/2). The transform here is
//        written to also work when a non-rectangular shape mask lands later.
//   §4.3 placement rules — every footprint tile must be inscribed in the
//        island ellipse (§3.4), no tile may overlap any existing footprint,
//        and the def must be tier-unlocked (§9.2 / §13.1).
//   §4.4 adjacency — metadata only; effect computation DEFERRED (no consumer
//        wired yet — Step 11 added the heat-source flag plumbing but the
//        per-frame buff computation is still a future step).
//
// Other deferrals documented at the call sites:
//   - Terrain-tile requirements per §4.3 / §8.1 are implemented.
//     `validatePlacement` checks `def.requiredTile` against `spec.terrainAt`.
//   - Adjacency effects (§4.5) — DEFERRED.
//   - Placement-time material cost — DEFERRED. Placement is free in step 2.5;
//     real costs land in step 14 alongside the cost-curve work.
//   - Demolition — DEFERRED. Placed buildings cannot be removed in step 2.5.
//
// No PixiJS, no DOM, no IslandState construction-time helpers — this module
// is pure: takes a spec + state + def id + anchor + rotation, returns a
// validation verdict, optionally appends a new PlacedBuilding.

 *   - Credits `state.inventory.scrap`, clamped to the post-demolish scrap cap.
 *   - Credits each §14 refund resource to `state.inventory[r]`, clamped to
