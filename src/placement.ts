// Building placement — pure tile math + validation + state mutation.
//
// SPEC §4 in summary:
//   §4.1 footprint shapes — buildings cover one or more tiles via an explicit
//        `ShapeMask` (a set of tile offsets). Rectangular masks are provided
//        by the `SHAPES` library in `shape-mask.ts`; L-tromino / tetromino
//        variants are available for future defs.
//   §4.2 rotation — 4-way (0/90/180/270 CW). For a rectangle this just swaps
//        width/height on rotation 1/3 (no-op on 0/2). The transform here is
//        written to also work when a non-rectangular shape mask lands later.
//   §4.3 placement rules — every footprint tile must be inscribed in the
//        island ellipse (§3.4), no tile may overlap any existing footprint,
//        and the def must be tier-unlocked (§9.2 / §13.1).
//   §4.4 adjacency — metadata flagged on each PlacedBuilding; the heat-source
//        side (§5.2) and reactor toxicity are wired. §4.5 Wastewater
//        Treatment and Exhaust Scrubber soft-gates are live. The Cooling
//        Tower → Crystal Lab unlock remains STILL-DEFERRED.
//
// Other deferrals documented at the call sites:
//   - Terrain-tile requirements per §4.3 / §8.1 are implemented.
//     `validatePlacement` checks `def.requiredTile` against `spec.terrainAt`.
//   - Placement-time material cost is wired alongside the §15 cost-curve.
//   - Demolition is wired (refund per §4.6).
//
// No PixiJS, no DOM, no IslandState construction-time helpers — this module
// is pure: takes a spec + state + def id + anchor + rotation, returns a
// validation verdict, optionally appends a new PlacedBuilding.

 *      per-resource. A 30-stone Mine demolition refunds 15 stone; a
 *      15-wood Mine refunds 7 wood. Each refund entry is clamped to its
 *      resource cap (the §4.6 "excess is lost" rule applies to refunds
 *      the same way it applies to recipe production). Buildings without
 *      a `placementCost` (defensively — every shipped def carries one
 *      post-§14) demolish without a placement-cost refund but still earn
 *      the Scrap credit.
 *
 * Mutations on the `{ ok: true }` path:
 *   - Removes the building from `spec.buildings` (state.buildings is the
 *     same array reference, so both stay consistent).
 *   - For storage defs (def.storage defined): subtracts the `storage.capacity`
 *     contribution from every category-matching resource (specialized) or
 *     only the building's cargoLabel resource (generic). Mirrors the
 *     `placeBuilding` bump exactly, so place→demolish round-trips to the
 *     same caps. Per §4.6 last paragraph ("If current inventory of any
 *     affected resource now exceeds the reduced cap, the excess is lost —
 *     inventory clamps down to the new cap"), we then clamp `inventory[r]`
 *     to the new cap on every affected resource. The storage strip runs
 *     BEFORE the §14 refund credit so refunds land into the post-demolish
 *     caps, not the pre-demolish caps (matters when demolishing a Crate
 *     whose own placement cost would have been refundable into the same
 *     resource it stored).
 *   - Credits `state.inventory.scrap`, clamped to the post-demolish scrap cap.
 *   - Credits each §14 refund resource to `state.inventory[r]`, clamped to
 *     the post-demolish cap on that resource.
 *
 * Returns `{ ok: false, reason: 'not-found' }` when the id isn't present —
 * a defensive guard so a stale UI handle (e.g., demolition button held
 * after the building was already removed) doesn't corrupt state. Pure
 * function in the §15.3-pure-layer sense: no DOM, no PixiJS.

// Ocean-layer §3 / §4 — sibling validator for ocean-placed buildings.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Ocean buildings are a SIBLING placement universe from the land
// `validatePlacement` flow: they're indexed by cell coords (not island-local
// tile coords), they validate against `world.oceanCells` (not an island's
// ellipse / terrain closure), and they anchor to a PICKED island (not the
// island whose footprint they sit on). Mixing the two flows into one
// validator would force every land caller to thread a `world` reference; a
// sibling function keeps the existing land path untouched.
//
// What this function gates (per §3 / §4 design doc):
//   1. defNotOcean   — defensive: caller routed a non-ocean def here.
//   2. terrainMismatch — at least one footprint cell's terrain isn't in
//                        `def.terrainReqs`. Uses `footprintMatches` from
//                        ocean-cell.ts so the rule is shared with sonar /
//                        future ocean-placement consumers.
//   3. noAnchorInRange — no populated island sits within
//                        ANCHOR_MAX_RANGE_CELLS of the placement cell. The
//                        anchor PICKER UI (mountAnchorPicker) consumes the
//                        same candidate list returned by `candidateAnchors`;
//                        rejecting up-front spares the player an empty
//                        modal.
//
// NOT gated here (and why):
//   - Cell overlap with other ocean buildings: ocean placements all flow
//     through the same `PlacedBuilding` array on whichever island they
//     anchor to; overlap detection lives downstream once the anchor is
//     picked. This stays out of the pure pre-anchor validator.
//   - Tier / unlock gates: caller has the island context (anchor candidate
//     list); the per-island level gate fires after the anchor is picked
//     via the existing `buildingUnlocked` path the UI already runs.
//   - Placement cost: same reason — costs come out of the anchor island's
//     inventory; checked at placeBuilding time.
//
// Footprint dims: `shapeWidth` / `shapeHeight` from shape-mask. Ocean
// buildings ignore rotation in the initial scope (every shipped def is a
// 2×2 square; rotation is a no-op for squares anyway). If a non-square
// ocean def ships later, thread a Rotation parameter through and call
// `rotatedDims` instead.
