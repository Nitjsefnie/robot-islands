// Pure economy math: event-driven piecewise integration per SPEC §15.3.
//
// No PixiJS, no DOM. Functions take an `IslandState` and mutate its
// `inventory`, `xp`, `level`, `unspentSkillPoints`, and `lastTick` fields.
// The pure shape makes the loop independently testable and the offline-catchup
// path (§15.5) trivially correct — the same loop handles 1 frame and 24 hours.
//
// The algorithm at a glance:
//
//   while (t < now) {
//     // 1. Compute per-building rates given current inventory state
//     //    Each building's effective rate = base × inputAvail × outputAvail
//     //    inputAvail is continuous [0,1] (bottleneck ratio)
//     //    outputAvail is binary 0|1 (cap headroom)
//     // 2. Find the next moment something changes (inventory hits 0 or cap)
//     // 3. Integrate over [t, nextEvent] with constant rates
//     // 4. Accrue XP proportional to PRODUCTION (gross outputs), not net flow
//     // 5. Advance t to nextEvent, loop
//   }
//
// Why event-driven: a naive `dt × rate` step over the whole interval would
// overshoot caps (e.g., produce 101 iron_ore when cap is 100) and consume
// inputs after they've gone to zero. Splitting at events keeps each segment
// linear and exact. The integration converges in O(events × resources)
// regardless of `now - lastTick`, so multi-day offline catchup is cheap.

 * — maintenance boundaries: without these, a 24h offline catchup would
 * integrate one giant segment at start-of-segment maintenance factor
 * (typically 1.0), missing the degradation entirely. Each sub-segment then
 * integrates at the start-of-segment factor; since the linear ramp is
 * monotonically DECREASING, that over-estimates production within the ramp.
 * The `MAINTENANCE_RAMP_SEGMENTS` constant in `maintenance.ts` bounds the
 * over-count to roughly `0.5 / (2 × ramp_segments)`.
 *
 * `tMs` and `nowMs` are wall-clock millisecond timestamps; `net` is in
