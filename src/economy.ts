// Pure economy math: event-driven piecewise integration per SPEC §15.3.
//
// No PixiJS, no DOM. Functions take an `IslandState` and mutate its
// `inventory`, `xp`, `level`, `unspentSkillPoints`, and `lastTick` fields.
// The pure shape makes the loop independently testable and the offline-catchup
// path (§15.5) trivially correct — the same loop handles 1 frame and 24 hours.
//
// The algorithm at a glance:
//
//   while (t < now) {
//     // 1. Compute per-building rates given current inventory state
//     //    Each building's effective rate = base × inputAvail × outputAvail
//     //    inputAvail is continuous [0,1] (bottleneck ratio)
//     //    outputAvail is binary 0|1 (cap headroom)
//     // 2. Find the next moment something changes (inventory hits 0 or cap)
//     // 3. Integrate over [t, nextEvent] with constant rates
//     // 4. Accrue XP proportional to PRODUCTION (gross outputs), not net flow
//     // 5. Advance t to nextEvent, loop
//   }
//
// Why event-driven: a naive `dt × rate` step over the whole interval would
// overshoot caps (e.g., produce 101 iron_ore when cap is 100) and consume
// inputs after they've gone to zero. Splitting at events keeps each segment
// linear and exact. The integration converges in O(events × resources)
// regardless of `now - lastTick`, so multi-day offline catchup is cheap.

/**
 * Advance one island from its `lastTick` to `nowMs` via event-driven
 * piecewise integration. Mutates state in place.
 *
 * Loop body per §15.3:
 *   1. computeRates at the current inventory (rates are constant within
 *      a segment by construction)
 *   2. findNextCapEvent — the timestamp of the next inventory transition
 *   3. integrate inventory + accrue XP over [t, nextEvent]
 *   4. levelUpIfReady (the gained XP may cross one or more thresholds)
 *   5. advance t and loop
 *
 * Termination: each iteration either (a) advances t to nowMs and exits, or
 * (b) drives at least one resource to a cap/zero boundary, which changes
 * the rate-set at the next iteration. The number of distinct rate-sets is
 * bounded by 2·|resources| (each resource can be "running" or "stalled"),
 * so the loop is O(resources²) in the worst case. The safety counter is
 * paranoia for floating-point edge cases.
