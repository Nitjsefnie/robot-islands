// Resources, recipes, and xp_weight table.
//
// Per SPEC §6 (Resource Catalog) and §7 (Recipe Chains) the full game has a
// large catalog. Step 3 needs only enough to drive two recipes through the
// `advanceIsland` tick loop:
//
//   - Mine: 1 iron_ore / 5s, no inputs (raw extraction)
//   - Workshop: 1 bolt from (1 iron_ore + 1 coal) / 10s
//
// `xp_weight` per SPEC §9.1: T0 raws = 1, T1 refined = 3, T2 component = 10.
// We mark iron_ingot at T1 weight even though step 3 has no recipe producing
// it — defining the constant now keeps the table consistent for future steps.
//
// Why bind recipes by `BuildingKind` rather than per-building instance:
// step 3 has hardcoded buildings (see buildings.ts) with no recipe field on
// the Building interface. A side-table keyed on `kind` lets us add recipes
// without touching the Building shape. When buildings become data-driven in
// a later step, the recipe can move onto the building definition itself.
