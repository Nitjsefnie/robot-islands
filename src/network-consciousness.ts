// Network Consciousness milestone per SPEC §9.6. Pure logic — no PixiJS,
// no DOM. Counts the player's T3+ islands and resolves the active milestone
// into a global production buff applied per frame in `main.ts`.
//
// Step-10 simplification: §9.6 defines the buff target set as "networked T3+
// islands" — islands route-graph-connected back to home (see §2.4). Step 10
// drops the "networked" qualifier and treats every populated island at T3+
// as participating. The route graph exists (`routes.ts`) but threading the
// reachability check here would dilute the focus of the step; the relaxation
// is documented and flagged for re-tightening once the route system carries
// the connectedness flag natively. Same approach as the §10.1 funnel
// provenance FIXME in `economy.ts`.
//
// Thresholds and buff magnitudes are per §9.6:
//   ≥3 T3+ islands  → milestone 1 / +5%
//   ≥5             → milestone 2 / +10%
//   ≥10            → milestone 3 / +25%
//   ≥20            → milestone 4 / Network Consciousness (still +25%; the
//                    "Omniscient Lattice unlock" downstream effect arrives
//                    with the T5 endgame artifact, not implemented yet).
//
// The buff itself is a single number returned alongside the milestone — the
// caller in `main.ts` decides whether to apply it to a given island (the
// design memo restricts application to T3+ islands, computed per-frame using
// `tierForLevel(state.level) >= 3`).
