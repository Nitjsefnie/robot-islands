// Network Consciousness milestone per SPEC §9.6. Pure logic — no PixiJS,
// no DOM. Counts the player's networked T3+ islands and resolves the active
// milestone into a global production buff applied per frame in `main.ts`.
//
// "Networked" means route-graph-reachable from home (§2.4). The BFS walks
// undirected edges: a route A→B makes B reachable from A and vice-versa.
// Only populated islands that are both T3+ and in the networked set count
// toward the milestone thresholds.
//
// Thresholds and buff magnitudes are per §9.6:
//   ≥3 T3+ islands  → milestone 1 / +5%
//   ≥5             → milestone 2 / +10%
//   ≥10            → milestone 3 / +25%
//   ≥20            → milestone 4 / Network Consciousness (still +25%; the
//                    "Omniscient Lattice unlock" downstream effect arrives
//                    with the T5 endgame artifact, not implemented yet).
//
// The buff itself is a single number returned alongside the milestone — the
// caller in `main.ts` decides whether to apply it to a given island (the
// design memo restricts application to T3+ islands, computed per-frame using
// `tierForLevel(state.level) >= 3`).
