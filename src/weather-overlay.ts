// §2.6 weather visualization layer.
//
// Each stratification cell carries a deterministic weather state (the pure
// `weather()` fn in weather.ts). The simulation uses that state for vehicle
// destruction, route capacity, and drone scan penalties — but the player
// needed a visible signal to dispatch launches strategically.
//
// Visibility: this overlay uses a *weather-specific* vision-source set
// (`computeWeatherVisionSources`), distinct from the ocean / Lighthouse
// vision graph. The current-cycle layer reveals cells that intersect:
//
//   (a) any populated island's ocean-padded ellipse (keeps the overlay
//       aligned with the visible water around each coast), AND
//   (b) a per-island weather circle of radius
//       `BASE_WEATHER_VISIBILITY_TILES (=5) + Σ station bonuses`. §2.6
//       station bonuses: T2 Weather Station +3 tiles, T3 Advanced Weather
//       Station +6 tiles. Multiple stations on the same island STACK
//       additively (matches the pinned `isWeatherVisible` test surface in
//       `weather.test.ts`).
//
// In addition, every island carrying an Advanced Weather Station (T3) emits
// a parallel *forecast* circle of the same radius. Cells in that forecast
// set get a second, lower-opacity sprite drawn on top, tinted by the
// weather state `WEATHER_FORECAST_LOOKAHEAD_MS` in the future — the
// "+1-cycle ahead forecasting" §2.6 promise. The lookahead is the
// arithmetic midpoint of the cell-dwell range (~2 h) since dwell is
// variable per cell and the spec doesn't pin a fixed cycle length.
//
// Lighthouses do NOT extend weather visibility — only the ocean ellipse
// (always present) and weather stations do. The earlier `computeVisionSources`
// piggyback that *did* leak Lighthouse range into the weather overlay has
// been replaced with the targeted source set above.
//
// Performance: visibleCellsFromVision is bounded by the source AABBs; the
// throttled rebuild (WEATHER_OVERLAY_REBUILD_MS = 5s) keeps Graphics churn
// negligible.
