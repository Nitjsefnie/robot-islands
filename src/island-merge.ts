// §3.6 Island Joining — pure logic for merging two overlapping islands.
//
// No PixiJS, no DOM. The economy ticker in main.ts calls `findNextMerge` once
// per tick after `advanceIsland` runs; if a pair is reported, `performMerge`
// mutates the world (absorber gains an extra constituent ellipse + the
// absorbed island's buildings + inventory + skill points), the absorbed
// island is removed from the world, and routes/drones/vehicles redirect.
//
// At most ONE merge runs per tick (§3.6 multi-overlap ordering). Remaining
// overlap pairs re-evaluate on the next tick, by which time the merged
// identity has new ellipses and may overlap further targets.
//
// `chooseMergeAbsorber` is the pure tiebreak ladder (tile count → level →
// id). `performMerge` is mutating; the caller owns calling it at most once
// per tick. `findNextMerge` walks all pairs and returns the "largest combined
// tile count, lower-id-first on tile-count tie" pair, or null when no pairs
// overlap.

 * Mutate `world` and `states` in place per §3.6 merge semantics:

 *      with offset `(absorbed.cx - absorber.cx, absorbed.cy - absorber.cy)`.
 *   2. Each of absorbed's buildings is appended to absorber's `buildings`
 *      array with coordinates shifted by the same offset (so they live in
 *      absorber's local frame). PlacedBuilding is `readonly x/y`, so we
 *      build a fresh object per building — never mutate in place.
 *   3. Absorbed's inventory transfers per-resource: `A.inv[r] = min(A.cap(r),
 *      A.inv[r] + B.inv[r])`. Overflow is silently dropped.
 *   4. Absorbed's spent-and-unspent skill points refund as unspent on
 *      absorber (the player can freely re-spec via the existing skill UI).
 *      `unlockedNodes` and `subPathProgress` on absorbed are discarded.
 *   5. Absorbed's level and XP are discarded; absorber's are preserved.
 *   6. Routes targeting absorbed redirect to absorber (`route.to = A.id`);
 *      routes leaving absorbed redirect (`route.from = A.id`). Routes
 *      between A and B (in either direction) are deleted (they become
 *      intra-island).
 *   7. Drones whose `fromIslandId === absorbed.id` redirect to absorber.
 *   8. Settlement vehicles whose `target === absorbed.id` retarget to
 *      absorber. Vehicles whose `from === absorbed.id` redirect their
 *      origin (in-flight cargo is unchanged).
 *   9. Absorbed is removed from `world.islands` and `states.delete`'d.
 *
 * Caller must invoke this AT MOST ONCE per tick (§3.6). After this returns,
 * `absorber` carries the new geometry and any later `islandsOverlap` test
 * sees the union footprint.
 *
 * `absorber.modifiers`, `absorber.specializationRole`, `absorber.name`, and
 * every other field stay as-is — only the geometry, buildings, inventory,
 * and skill-point fields update.
 *
 * Note on building coordinates: by SPEC §3.6 reasoning, two buildings can't
 * collide because the offset is non-zero. We don't verify this — the
 * absorbed island's buildings are pushed alongside absorber's; if a future
 * test fabricates a colliding case, footprint conflict resolution is
 * out-of-scope for §3.6 per the SPEC.
