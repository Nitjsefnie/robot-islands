// Drone fleet: pure logic for dispatch + capsule-corridor discovery (§11).
//
// No PixiJS, no DOM. The renderer in `drones-ui.ts` reads this module's state
// and draws; the economy ticker calls `tickDrones` once per frame to advance
// returns. Tests target this module directly.
//
// Step-6 scope notes (deferred bits flagged inline elsewhere):
//   - One drone class only — T2-equivalent constants. T3+ tiers, T4
//     omnidirectional pulse, T5 path-drawn, all deferred to step 9+.
//   - §2.6 weather destruction implemented.
//   - Tier-gating on Drone Pad deferred to step 9; for step 6 the Drone Pad
//     is hardcoded on the home island like Mine/Workshop are.
//   - Fuel grade matches the launching island's tier per §11.7 — resolved at
//     dispatch via `fuelForTier(tierForLevel(origin.level))` and stored on
//     the Drone record. A T1 island launches with biofuel, a T3 island with
//     aviation kerosene, etc. No fallback to lower grades.
