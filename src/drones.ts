// Drone fleet: pure logic for dispatch + capsule-corridor discovery (§11).
//
// No PixiJS, no DOM. The renderer in `drones-ui.ts` reads this module's state
// and draws; the economy ticker calls `tickDrones` once per frame to advance
// returns. Tests target this module directly.
//
// Step-6 scope notes (deferred bits flagged inline elsewhere):
//   - One drone class only — T2-equivalent constants. T3+ tiers, T4
//     omnidirectional pulse, T5 path-drawn, all deferred to step 9+.
//   - No weather destruction (no weather system yet — §11.4 deferred).
//   - Tier-gating on Drone Pad deferred to step 9; for step 6 the Drone Pad
//     is hardcoded on the home island like Mine/Workshop are.
//   - Fuel = Biofuel (T1, §11.7 fuel table). The Drone Pad nominally launches
//     T2 drones burning Diesel per spec, but step 6 has no Diesel chain;
//     using Biofuel here matches the home-island tier (T1) and the spec's
//     "fuel grade matches launching island's tier" rule.
